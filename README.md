## Objectives

* Graduation

### Key Take-Aways

* We have included introductory Ruby content as a test of what else Flatiron can provide
* Students will celebrate the completion of the course
* Students will have an opportunity to briefly discuss/review topics

### Teacher Note

Graduation will not take the entire day.  Extra time should be taken to review and teach some final concepts and go into topics that students can learn going forward.

Now that students have a grasp of JavaScript and how it works, this is a great time to show them just how powerful JS is.  Developing highly interactive websites is just an extension and continuation of what they've already learned.  The key isn't memorization, but a basic understanding of JS, planning properly, knowing how to debug and building in an interative process; the things they've covered already in this course.
